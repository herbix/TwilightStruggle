Each player has 5 cards they can use for the What If-events. They are Dummy, +1, +1, +2 and cancel opponent's card (or -1, -1, -2 for USSR). The Dummy can be reused, the others can not.

USSR generally wants low rolls, US wants high rolls

Here are the 6 events

Yalta and Potsdam

1: USSR receives 1 additional Influence anywhere in Europe during setup and may take one of Vietnam Revolts or Arab-Israeli War into hand before drawing

2-3: No effect

4-5: US may take Marshall Plan into hand before drawing.

6: 4-5 result and US goes first in all Early War turns.

VJ Day

1: 2-3 result and US/Japan Mutual Defense Pact moved to Mid War deck, add 1 USSR Influence in each of South Korea and Japan in setup.

2-3: Add 1 Influence in South Korea during setup.

4-5: No effect.

6: Remove Korean War from the game. On turn 1, US ignores Defcon restrictions and Defcon cannot go below 2.

Chinese Civil War

1: Remove Ussuri River Skirmish from the game.

2-3: No effect

4-5: China Card begins face down.

6: 4-5 and Taiwan is now a permanent battleground country. Add 3 US influence in Taiwan during setup. Replace Formosan Resolution with Nationalist China card.

Nationalist China is a recurring 2 OPS US Early War event with the following effect: Place 3 influence in Asia, no more than 1 per country.

Israel:

1: 2-3 and USSR receives 2 Influence anywhere in the Middle East during setup (no more than 1 per country).

4-5: No effect.

6: Both players receive 2 influence in East Germany (USSR does not receive the 3 they normally get). Blockade has no effect. Replace Europe Scoring with Europe Scoring Allied Berlin.

Europe Scoring Allied Berlin is similar to Europe Scoring, except that domination scores 6 instead of 7 and Control scores 6 instead of winning the game.
